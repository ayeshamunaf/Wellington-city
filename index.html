        <h1>Wellington City's Network</h1>
        <p id="main">Wellington city's network infrastructure is hidden in plain sight if you know where to <br>look for them.At the beginning, it may seem difficult to identify them, but once you figure <br>out what you are looking for things will start to fall into place. Below is some network <br>infrastructure in the city that were observed and documented.

            <h2>Manhole Covers</h2>
            <p>Manhole covers are one point of entry into the city's underground world, and their designs indicate <br>what part of that world they connect to. Here are some manhole covers that might help you identify <br>pieces of the internet and networks.</p>

                    <p>These structures set below ground that protect telecommunications cables, <br>providing convenient access for splicing or pulling cable. You have probably <br>walked by lots of pull boxes before and not really know what they do.</p>

            <h2>Street Markings</h2>
            <p>Sometimes you'll see a manhole cover that is surrounded with colourful markings. Whenever a contractor <br>or construction company plans to do street excavation, utility companies will mark out the location<br> of their underground cables so that the contractor knows to watch out for them.</p>

            <h2>Cameras</h2>
            <p>Admittedly, much of this guide has focused on seeing internet-connected networks in the field networks that,<br> for the most part, the reader has access to. But the city is also full of networked objects that, while often serving a <br>public interest, aren't connected to public networks. These sensors vary from monitoring vehicular traffic to recording <br>water usage. Surveillance cameras are perhaps one of the more noticeable and contested forms of networked objects in public <br>space. The public "connects" to surveillance networks all the time, albeit involuntarily, and this section offers a view <br>into who controls some of the ubiquitous networks.</p>

                <p>This type of cameras can be spotted mainly on publics transport and some main interactions in the city, next to traffic lights. These cameras monitor and store <br>data that would be obtained when needed.</p>

            <h2>Various Antenna</h2>
            <p>Tracking things on the ground can sometimes be tricky markings and manhole covers get worn down and faded, they're <br>sometimes in the middle of the road, and it's easy to bump into things when looking down all the time. Here are some <br>other objects that indicate pieces of the network.</p>

                <p>These grey signal control boxes attached to traffic signal posts are just one <br>piece of a massive system of networked objects. Each signal control box contains wireless routing equipment and traffic controllers that connect back to a fibre hub. </p>

                     <p>A Distributed Antenna System (DAS) is basically a way to expand a cell network's <br>reach, adding capacity in under-covered areas. They're a little easier to find <br>on the street because they're not on top of buildings they're attached to street <br>poles and linked to underground fibre-optic networks.</p>
